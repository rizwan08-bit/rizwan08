- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Age Group vs Total Amount**: Shows which age groups spend the most.
- **State vs Orders**: Highlights top states contributing to sales.
- **Gender Analysis**: Compares total number of orders and sales amount by gender.
- **Occupation**: Distribution of customers by profession.
